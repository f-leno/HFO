Run experiments:

./experiments/run.sh -o=2 -d=1 -t=10 -f=100 -r=1 -a=Dummy -i=5 -e=5

-i is the number of learning trials before each evaluation
-e is the number of trials executed in each evaluation

Then the experiment will run with the Dummy agent. It automatically
calculates the total trials and the evaluation trials and calls the
server accordingly. It saves all to ./experiments/LOGS/ directory with
a file for every agent in every run and the server info in incomplete_?.hfo.


Start experiment for debugger:
./bin/HFO --offense-agents 2 --defense-npcs 1 --trials 20 --frames-per-trial 100 --fullstate
python experiment.py -a Dummy  -i 5 -d 5 -t 10 -l /home/leno/HFO/HFO-master/log/Dummy


IMPORTANT:
- These are the files we work with:
     run.sh
     experiment.py
     statespace_util.py
     agents/agent.py
     agents/dummy.py
     agents/dummycom.py
     agents/sarsa.py


List of TODOs as in 07/09:

- Make SARSA work:
  -- Implement executionAction method in experiment.py - **Done [Leno]
  -- Implement localFeatures method in experiment.py - **Done [Leno]
  -- Check if the CMAC is working for state space approximation
  -- Check if the Q-function is working with the CMAC based features
- Implement our proposal:
  -- Modify the communication implemented in the DummyCom agent to the
     sarsa-based one - **Done - tests pending [Leno]
  -- Change the exploration strategy to work with advising
  -- Implement a method to translate one agent's state to another (maybe
     transferring the CMAC state in a message is enough)
  -- Implement the importance-based advising with our metrics
  -- Check if the PASS actions are being advised correctly
  -- Include in the output files the average of budget use
- Check Environment
  -- Is there a golie in the environment? YES
  -- Are the agent starting the trials in random positions? YES
- Implement Torrey and Taylor proposal
   -- Modify our proposal to work with theirs importance metric
- Implement graph output methods (only if we have enough-time, a hand-tailored
  MATLAB graph can also be used)
